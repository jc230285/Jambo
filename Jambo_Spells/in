i want a minimap button that brings up a ui



the up displays a table with sort-able headers that can sort by HPS HPM DPS DPM



hide spells that are not the highest rank learned, best for each DPS HPS DPM HPM



list them with on the left if if there data for the veriable columns are

NAME (R1-LVL) [TPYE]

HEAL_TOTAL=0,

DMG_TOTAL=0,

HPS=0,

HPM=0,

DPS=0,

DPM=0,



on hover

Description

Slots: {Slots}

Tags: {Tags}

CAST_TIME=0, MANA_COST=0, AURATIME=0, RANGE=0,

local e = {

TYPE = "MACRO", # SPELL pr ITEM

NAME = name or ("Macro "..id), # spell name, item name

description = body or "", # tooltip # macro body

Keybind=C1, '# actionbar Keybind

LEVEL = 0,

RANK= 1,

TAGS = {}, # Interupt, Dispell, Player Buff, Party Buff, can be multiple

CATEGORY = "", #Heal Harm Other

SLOTS = {}, # actionbar slotif 1-120

HEAL_TOTAL=0, DMG_TOTAL=0, # calculate HOT or DOT

HPS=0, HPM=0, DPS=0, DPM=0,

CAST_TIME=0, MANA_COST=0, AURATIME=0, RANGE=0,

}







required tallet is rank 1



it needs to have an export button to export the data in JSON



it needs to have a manual refresh button but will refresh on open and reload



it needs to load the data base from the files for each class i have i have them all but heres examples



it needs other addons to be able to access the data for each spell name it needs to return all data available



well be building an addon that uses this data



i want the ui to me dragable resizable and tabble to be sortable by any column



all class files are in



Jambo_Spells\Classes\Classic



only load the class file for the class logged in

can we also get all useable items in bags and create and maintain macros for lowest healing potiona and lowest mana potion lowest food and lowest drink, update macros on bag change



start macros at account macro id 80
